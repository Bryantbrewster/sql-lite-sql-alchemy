<!--This is a form that uses the book data that was passed in (called: book) and displays the title and rating. It then
has an input where the user can type in a new rating that will override the old one, along with a submit button. This
also contains a hidden input (line 14), called "id" that holds the id of the book whose rating is being edited. This
value will then be included when the form data is sent back to the edit function upon submission.-->
